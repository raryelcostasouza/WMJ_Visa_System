v1.6 - 09/12/2017
Updated:
* Java Runtime Environment
* Hibernate Library
* Derby DB

Bugs fixed:
* New Visa::Letters: Field height sometimes shrinks (Embassy, Address, Phone Number) on section "Monastic Abroad - Samnak Put". However it shows normally after moving to Forms/Register Visa tab and back.
* Embassy panel: Unsaved changes are saved even when choosing to discard changes.
* Profile panel: When changing nickname, the photo on profile panel as well as the top monastic selector does not update properly.
* Passport panel: reset fScanSelected1, fScanSelected2, fScanSelected3 to null whenever load the panel. 
                            This would cause bugs, if for example, a scan3 was added for a certain profile, and on a second profile 
                             the user tried to add the first scan. In this case the system was requiring the information of the scan3 to be
                             filled in.

* Embassy panel: focus order of the text fields
* Add passport panel: focus order of the text fields
* Baisuddhi panel & Printed Doc Stock: Scrollbar added
* 90 Day Notice panel::Receipts Online Notice: Receipts Online ordered by Date descending.
* New Visa::Letters: Do not allow comma in fields that will be exported into csv file.
