		K. Fredrik - Due Date 23/12/2020 - Remaining time 3 year(s) 27 day(s) - should say 3 year(s) 11 month(s) 27 day(s).

	* Saved Printouts TM 30: Monastics column is not wide enough to show all names.
	* Monastic Profile (Dhamma Studies): Save button doesn't activate when editing this field.
	* Due Tasks (90 Day Notice/Visa Extension table): Remaining Time column is not wide enough.
